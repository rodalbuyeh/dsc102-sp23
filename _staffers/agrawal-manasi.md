Hello everyone! My name is Eric and I’m a second-year Data Science major from Orange County. When I’m not focused on school, I really like watching food-related videos and listening to K-Pop (been listening to a lot of ENHYPEN and LE SSERAFIM). This is the last quarter before I complete a full year of tutoring, so I'm very excited about this. I can’t wait to meet you all and I hope we will be able to learn a lot from each other!
