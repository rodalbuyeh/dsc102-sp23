Hi there, my name is Rod and I am looking forward to teaching DSC 102 this quarter. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and spent all of my academic and professional life between northern and southern California (Mountain View, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and now San Diego). I received my PhD in 2016 from a quant-heavy Political Science program at USC where I studied political belief systems and threat response. Following that, I worked in data science and machine learning architecture roles at larger companies like Intuit and ResMed, as well as smaller FinTech startups like Figure and Oportun. Today I run a machine learning consultancy and help companies scale, automate, and productionize their workloads. I also love teaching and am returning to UCSD after a brief teaching stint during the pandemic. Outside of data science, I am an avid (and sometimes competitive) mixed martial artist, musician, tinkerer, armchair philosopher, and dad. I also have a cat named Foosball and a dog named Lola.

I am excited about the content we will be covering in this course because it is foundational to most of the core algorithms you will be using in your career, whether you are working in "lift and churn" business applications or the next LLM. The tools you learn here will serve you for the long haul.
