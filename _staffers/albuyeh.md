Hi there, I'm Rod and I am looking forward to teaching DSC 102 this quarter. I was born and raised in the Bay Area and have spent my entire education and professional life in northern and southern California. I received my PhD in 2016 from a quant-heavy Poli Sci program at USC where I studied how people respond to threatening political behavior. Following that, I worked in data science and machine learning architecture roles at bigger companies like Intuit and ResMed, as well as smaller FinTech startups like Figure and Oportun. Currently, I am teaching part-time at UCSD while running my own ML consultancy. I work in a variety of domains, but specialize in time-series tabular prediction as well as ML platform design. Outside of data science, I am an avid (and sometimes competitive) mixed martial artist, musician, tinkerer, and dad.

I am excited about the content we will be covering in this course because it is foundational to most of the core algorithms you will be using in your career, whether you are working in "lift and churn" business applications or the next LLM. The tools you learn here will serve you for the long haul.
