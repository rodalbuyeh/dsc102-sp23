# Overview

This course covers the principles of computing systems and tools for 
scaling data analytics to large datasets. Scalable analytics systems
are a central part of modern data science in numerous application 
domains spanning enterprise business intelligence, Web search, e-commerce, 
social media, natural and social sciences, healthcare, digitial 
humanities, e-governance, Internet of Things, and more.

Topics include computer organization, memory hierarchy, basics of 
operating systems, scalable and parallel computing, cloud computing, 
design and use of parallel dataflow systems, and the use of deep 
learning tools. It will cover how relational algebra, SQL, linear 
algebra, and more general dataflow operations in such systems can 
be used to perform data preparation and feature engineering for 
machine learning (ML) at scale, how to scale ML training, how to 
perform ML model selection and deployment at scale, and how to handle 
data heterogeneity. It will also introduce the implementation of 
such data systems and touch upon the latest research in this space.

A major component of this course is hands-on Python programming to 
implement data exploration, data preparation, and model selection 
pipelines on large real-world data using scalable analytics tools 
and cloud resources.

#### Course Format

- The class meets 2 times a week for 80-minute lectures. Attendance is
mandatory. While lecture slides will be made available on this webpage, 
additional content might be discussed in class. 

- Three programming assignments. See the PAs page for the PA schedule 
and details. There are no late days allowed for the assignments. Plan
your work accordingly.

- This course will have one in-class midterm exam and one cumulative 
final exam. The exams will both be held in-person. If you miss an exam,
you will receive no credit for it, unless you notify the instructor in 
advance with a university approved reason and receive a makeup time slot.
The exam will include multiple choice an dlonger-form problems. Some
questions will have partial credits. For both exams, you are allowed 
to keep with you two A4-sized sheets (four sides) with any content you
want.

- There will be (many) surprise quizzes on random lecture dates to 
help you retain the material. These will constitute your participation
score.
 
- The discussion sections will be used by the TAs to prepare you for the 
programming assignment and help you gain experience with cloud components.

- We will have a number of guest lecturers from industry, with opportunities 
both during class and outside of class. If the guest lecture occurs during
class, the content discussed is fair game for the final. If it occurs
outside of class, the content offers a small opportunity for extra credit
on a midterm or final.  

&nbsp;

#### Prerequisites

- DSC 100 (Introduction to Data Management); or substantial practical 
experience with scalable data systems and ML, subject to the consent 
of the instructor.

- Proficiency in Python programming.

#### Grading Components

- midterm exam: 15%
- programming assignments: 8% + 16% + 16%
- surprise quizzes: 10%
- cumulative final: 35%
- guest lecture extra credit: 4% (likely)

#### Grading Cutoffs

Since this is a newly adapted version of this course, the grading 
scheme is a hybrid of absolute and relative grading to mitigate the 
"cold start" issue. The absolute cutoffs are based on your absolute 
total score. The relative bins are based on your position in the total
score distribution of the class. The better grade among the two 
(absolute-based and relative-based) will be your final grade. The 
cutoffs listed below offer a minimum guarantee on your grade; some 
thresholds might be lowered slightly later by the instructor but they 
will not be raised.

| Grade | Absolute Cutoff (>=) | Relative Bin (Use strictest)
| --- | --- |  --- |
| A+ | 95 | Highest 5% |
| A | 90 | Next 10% (5-15) |
| A- | 85 | Next 15% (15-30) |
| B+ | 80 | Next 15% (30-45) |
| B | 75 | Next 15% (45-60) |
| B- | 70 | Next 15% (60-75) |
| C+ | 65 | Next 5% (75-80) |
| C | 60 | Next 5% (80-85) |
| C- | 55 | Next 5% (85-90) |
| D | 50 | Next 5% (90-95) |
| F | <50 | Lowest 5% |


**Example**: Suppose the total score is 82 and the percentile is 33. 
So, the relative grade is B-, while the absolute grade is B+. The 
final grade then is B+.
